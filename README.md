## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this plugin work with my theme?

Simple WP Optimizer is designed to be compatible with most WordPress themes. The optimizations focus on removing unnecessary WordPress elements rather than modifying theme functionality.

### What does "Remove jQuery Migrate" do?

jQuery Migrate is a script that helps maintain backward compatibility with older jQuery code. Modern themes and plugins generally don't need it, so removing it can improve load time without affecting functionality in most cases.

### What does "Disable WordPress Emojis" do?

This option removes emoji-related scripts and styles that WordPress adds by default. Most websites don't need these resources, so removing them can reduce HTTP requests and improve page load time.

### Will removing the WordPress version improve security?

Yes, hiding the WordPress version can provide a minor security benefit by making it slightly more difficult for potential attackers to identify vulnerability targets based on your WordPress version.

## Development

### Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- WordPress 6.5 or higher
- Composer (for development and testing)

### Setting up the development environment

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/EngineScript/simple-wp-optimizer.git`
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
3. Set up the test environment: `bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest`
4. Run tests: `composer test`

### PHP 8.x Compatibility

This plugin is fully compatible with PHP versions 7.4 through 8.4. For testing with PHP 8.x, we provide a custom PHPUnit runner script that helps avoid common compatibility issues between PHPUnit and newer PHP versions:

```bash
# For PHP 7.4 (standard testing)
composer test

# For PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 (using the custom runner)
composer test:php8
```

The custom runner automatically detects your PHP version and applies the appropriate compatibility settings.

## Development & Maintenance

### Automated WordPress Compatibility

This repository uses the [WordPress Version Checker](https://github.com/skaut/wordpress-version-checker) GitHub Action to automatically monitor WordPress compatibility. When a new WordPress version is released, the action:

1. Creates a pull request to update the "Tested up to" version in readme.txt
2. Adds "automated" and "documentation" labels to the PR
3. Assigns repository maintainers for review

This ensures our plugin stays up-to-date with the latest WordPress versions without manual intervention.

### Automated Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive PHPUnit test suite that runs automatically on GitHub Actions. Our testing matrix includes:

- PHP versions: 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
- WordPress versions: 6.5, latest, nightly
- Both single site and multisite installations

This ensures code quality and compatibility across different PHP versions and WordPress configurations.
