### Fixed

## [1.8.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- Added new option to remove RSD (Really Simple Discovery) link from WordPress header
- **NEW FEATURE**: Added separate DNS Prefetch option alongside Preconnect for better resource hint control
  - DNS-prefetch performs lighter-weight DNS-only lookups for less critical domains

  - Clear UI explanations help users understand when to use each option
- Added preconnect domains: `https://s.w.org`, `https://wordpress.com`, `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, and `https://www.googletagmanager.com`
- Added DNS prefetch domain: `https://adservice.google.com`

### Changed
- **PERFORMANCE UPGRADE**: Changed from DNS-prefetch to Preconnect for better performance
  - Preconnect establishes full connection (DNS + TCP + TLS) vs dns-prefetch which only does DNS lookup
  - Adds `crossorigin` attribute for font domains (required for CORS requests)
  - Improves Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP) metrics
- Updated default preconnect domains to remove deprecated Google CDN URLs (`ajax.googleapis.com` and `apis.google.com`)
